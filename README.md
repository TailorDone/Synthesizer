<h1> Synthesizer </h1>
<h2> CS6011 Project </h2>

## Project Description
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>The Prompt:</b> "Create a Synthesizer using Object-Oriented Programming." </li>
    <li><b>The Set-Up:</b> A week long project building on the concepts of inheritance, interfaces, overriding, abstract classes. </li>
    <li><b>The Tools:</b> This project was created in IntelliJ IDEA with use of Java, JavaFX, and Gradle.</li> 
  </ul>
 </p>
 
 ## The Synthesizer
 <p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Mechanics:</b> Upon launch the user can select different widgets to drag onto the screen. If the user would like to play multiple sounds at once then the use of a Mixer will be implemented. No sound will play without a speaker. Users can adjust settings such as volume and frequency. The user can connect elements together by selecting a grey output port and then a white input port. Pressing play will start the sound.</li>
  </ul>

## Additional Information
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>What I Would Improve:</b> Given more time I would love to make a dynamic line draw as I connect one widget to another. I would also like to make the widgets move and have the lines move with the widgets. </li>
  </ul>
